# Battlebot

Battlebot is a small discord integration for the battlerite API

The project is still in progress. If you want to test it out, the only thing you need to do is to create a `config.json` file at the root of the project that will look like this :
```json
{
    "apiKey" : "YOUR API KEY HERE"
}
```
